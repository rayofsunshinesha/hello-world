When I was a graduate student, I was so broke. Any chance there is free food, I take advantage of it. I mean it. So, the way the maximize 
opportunies like this is go to university website and look at each events, whichever mentioned food is provided, I will be there. Or 
sometimes, even it doesn't say it. As long as the event is around lunch or dinner time, I will still go. The odd that there is some sort of 
food there is very high.

Because I have a purpose of going to grab food, the content of the event become secondary. It for me more like a price that comes with the
free food. At first, I was shy, so it is not so comfortable. But after several times, my skin becomes thinker and thinker that my new 
comfort zone has expanded. 

It is because of those event, I got a chance to learn diversity. It is because of those event, I got forced to social with people. It is 
because of those event, I got to know people who are not my classmate or Chinese students. I really benefit from all those events and 
learned a ton. Free food is the motivivation that get me going!
