I felt frustrated often when I was on the phone with someone trying to resolve a issue. The person on the phone with me would tell me that
they can not understand me. This phenomena lasted for several years since I came to the States.

Therefore, in my first few years as a student, I just walked over to whatever office I need to resolve the issue with and talk to them in
person. The benefit of doing so is I can use my body lauguage as a compensation of my accent barrier. I can point at a form and look at them
in the eyes very confusely or innocently (depents on your goal) to let them know I don't know what and how to accomplish the task. 

For example, paying student fee, I was not familiar with writing checks. Neither do I know on how much exactly I was suppose to pay. 
Therefore, I would make the trip to student account office and pay the fee in person. This way, if you don't know who to write the check
to, the accountant there would help you and writing down the exact word. All you need to do is simply copy. 

The side benefit of that is it brings extra exercises. As long as you remember to smile, people often are very polite.
