It was my first semester, one of the classes that had the most credit hours was taught by a professor with an heavy accent and a doctor
style heand-writing. He is a well respected professor in the department. He was from India and came to the US probaboly half centray ago. 
I was a new graduate student with a broke english. It was advanced micro or macro. I couldn't distinguish those two because I have wasted
all my undergrad learning oppurtunities. 

Because he is so famous and old school, none of the students have ever darl to fall alseep in his class. But I couldn't understand a thing 
of what he is talking about. I can't hold myself awake. My head was knocking the table like I am a woodpacker. His headwriting looked like 
a waving line to me, I can't copy any of the note. The only hope I have is after every class, borrow the note from my american classmate 
- Rainna and copy it. Copying the note is my way of learning the material. I was so lucky to sit next to Rainna and she was kind enough to 
lend her note to me every time. 

A different between a note and a good note is the note-taker. A good note, there are highlights and self-reflected understanding for 
comment. When you are copying it, it is like a youtube video walking you through the logic. Then, you would ask, is there a yelp review to find out
who is the good note-taker? No. The trick is sitting in the very front row. The pro is the likelyhood that your neighboor is a good note-taker 
is very high. The con is that whenever I fall asleep, everyone would notice it.
