When I was a kid, English textbook started with 2 character, Li Lei and Han Meimei. The conversation go like this: "how do you do? Fine. 
And you? I am fine too. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too" We memorized this conversation again and again. That's how I always 
thought what people say to each other when they met.

Forwarding 10+ years, I am a new graduate student in the US midwest. People in hallway (who I have no idea who that person is) would ask me:
'How are you doing?' My brain sense the question, and it started nervously scramble some word together: 'Ummm, I have 2 exams coming. One 
is econometrics on Thursday and another one is .....' As dumb as I am to understand body languge, I see that person's eye fading away. In 
my head, I was thinking I am just trying to be polite, you started the conversation first and I don't even know who you are. 

It stayed as a myth for such a long time until one professor reveal the truth. I was in my MBA leadership class, Dr. Rangor told us that 
Americans ask how are you doing, but when it comes down, they don't care. Aha, that is why that person is fading away.
